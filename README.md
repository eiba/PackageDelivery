Website design:
The design has been split into 2 designs, one for the part that is meant to be mobile firendly
and one where that is not needed. That means that the design in some panels like the user management 
page in admin has more advanced design features like partial page updates with ajax and vue making it 
update asynchronously and disply nice modal boxes instead of displaying whole new views.
In the mobile firendly views, however the design is simpler but again works very well on a mobile phone.

In short, the difference in design for some pages is intended.
